    <h1>Ege Can Taslicukur</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m a programmer based in Istanbul, TÃ¼rkiye ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·.</p>
    <p>
      I specialize in building data-driven applications with <strong>R</strong> and
      <strong>Shiny</strong>, turning raw data into beautiful interactive
      dashboards. I'm also quite experienced in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong
        >SQL</strong
      >, and the holy trinity of web development (<strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong
        >HTML</strong
      >, <strong>CSS</strong>). I enjoy working across the stack, from AI/ML
      models and data pipelines to dynamic web interfaces.

      This site is built with <strong>Astro</strong> framework. The animated background
      draws ASCII characters driven by <strong>Perlin noise</strong> on an html canvas,
      dynamically modulated by mouse position. Click anywhere to cycle through color
      palettes. You can also find the source code in my public <a
