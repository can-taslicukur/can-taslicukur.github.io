    <h1>Ege Can Taslicukur</h1>
    <p>I‚Äôm a programmer based in Istanbul, T√ºrkiye üáπüá∑.</p>
    <p>
      I specialize in building data-driven applications with <strong>R</strong> and
      <strong>Shiny</strong>. I'm also quite experienced in <strong
        >Python</strong
      >, <strong>SQL</strong>, and the holy trinity of web development (<strong
        >JavaScript</strong
      >, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>). I enjoy working across
      the stack, from AI/ML models and data pipelines to dynamic web interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is built with <strong>Astro</strong> framework. The animated background
      draws ASCII characters driven by <strong>Perlin noise</strong> on an html canvas,
      dynamically modulated by mouse position. Click on the background to cycle through
      different colors. You can also find the source code in my public <a
        href="https://github.com/can-taslicukur/can-taslicukur.github.io"
        target="_blank">Github repo</a
