THIS IS MY WEBSITE.

There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Programming is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, this codebase is just another abandoned side project. Without this codebase, I have to talk to people.

I must program my website true. I must fix things no one notices.

I must ship before the coffee wears off. I WILL.

This site and I are bound by late nights, caffeine, and sheer will.

Before developing features no one asked for, I swear this creed.

My website and myself are defenders of my personal brand.

We are the masters of bugs. We are the survivors of my code.

So be it, until there are no bugs, but peace.

AMEN
